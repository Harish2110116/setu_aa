Backend | AA Integration


Problem


We would like you to build an end-to-end demo using the SETU Account Aggregator API where:




You establish a consent handshake (create and approve)



You create a data session


You fetch sample data 



You will be using the SETU AA sandbox environment (setup info is below). Their docs are here. 


Setu Sandbox Setup


We have created a test FIU account in the sandbox environment (“bridge”) of the AA, Setu. You will be handshaking with their API using the client_id and client_secret to complete consent and fetch the information of a user. 



See the quick start guide here and use Postman setup to make the calls. 




Deadline & Deliverables


Our expectation is that you're spending less than 4 hours on the problem. Hence you have one day to complete and submit your solution.




Appendix 1 - Account Aggregators Overview


Banks offer loans by reviewing the customer’s financial data -- How much do they earn? ; What is their average bank balance and transactions for the last year? ; Do they have deposits and other investments? What is their credit score from CIBIL? etc. Collecting all this information as well verifying the authenticity of the information is difficult and time consuming. The process also forces the customers to share a lot more information than necessary, and do so in unsecure channels (Whatsapp, Emails) exposing their sensitive information and making them vulnerable to data leaks. 


India Stack is changing this via Account Aggregators. Account Aggregators (AA) are non-banking financial companies, licensed by RBI, that act like a bridge, to deliver data from Financial Information Providers or FIPs (entities that hold a customer’s data, such as the tax department and banks) that hold your personal or corporate financial data to Financial Information Users or FIUs (entities that request customer data such as investment firms and other organizations who offer financial products and services) that are providing financial services to you. The purpose of an AA is not to sell, see or store financial information. They only collect and transmit it, securely and after gaining consent from the customer.


Account Aggregators solve the central issue of financial data collection and submission. They also ensure, for the very first time, that customer data remains private and protected. It is for these reasons account aggregators take a customer-first approach, i.e., they put the customer at the center.
